# mybots

Slowly putting all the bots into one repo for convenience. Also an example of one way to run a stable of Twitter bots from Python Anywhere, in case anyone cares.

Based on Thricedotted's [Twitterbot framework](https://github.com/thricedotted/twitterbot), but I'm mangling the innards enough that I'm not keeping it as a fork.
